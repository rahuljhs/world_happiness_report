        <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h4>Questions about the dataset</h4>
            <p>
                In order to begin the design process we crafted 4 main questions to investigate about the dataset.
                For each of these main questions, we posed an additional 1-2 questions to investigate the main question further.
                The questions this visualization is designed for the user to investigate are the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What country(countries) are the happiest?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>What makes a country happy?</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Is happiness correlated with X (metric)?</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <li>What does the global distribution of happiness look like?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>What does the global distribution of X (metric) look like?</li>
                    <li>Are any metrics clustered in certain areas as the highest/lowest?</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Where does X country rank in global happiness?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Where does X country rank in global Y (metric)?</li>
                </ol>
                <li>How do the countries I select compare in overall happiness?</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>How do the countries selected compare in X (metric)</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>

            <h4>Layout</h4>
                <p>
                    Layout was determined after a number of design iterations intended to maximize clarity, visual appeal, and complementing information. The core of the layout was the heat map of the countries against one of our 8 primary attributes. The heat map would be able to immediately identify any correlations between global position (or region) and any particular attribute. As the map was the most visually appealing component, there was a group consensus to place this in an attention grabbing position (left, centered). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next consensus was to include a scatter-plot to show relationships between multiple attributes. There was a design  iteration that included the scatterplot below and one adjacent to the map. The position of the scatter-plot was determined by the choice of 3rd visualization. As the other 2 visualizations were intended to show relationships, it was apparent that there was not an easy way to determine attribute rankings. A linear bubble chart was considered, but ultimately had too many overlaps with the scatterplot. The bar graph was deemed the clearest visualization to answer these questions. As the bar graph could require significant horizontal real estate, the scatter-plot was moved adjacent to the map with the bar graph spanning the bottom of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the data immediately available and as self-evident as possible, a set of data selectors were placed across the top of the page. As the data was arranged by year, country, and 8 attributes, we placed selectors for the year, attribute 1, and attribute 2 to filter data on the map, scatter-plot, and bar plot. The region was included once it became apparent that it would be useful to narrow down the focus to smaller sections of the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the scatter-plot was required to present large quantities of data in a limited page real estate, a “scoreboard” was added to give specific attribute values when a particular country was hovered over. This greatly increased the legibility of the scatter-plot and helped add specification to the attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map would provide the most information by being presented as a heat map, so a legend was provided to make the relative percentile of the country readily apparent. To emphasize a smaller subset, a select feature was added that recolors data on the map, scatterplot, and bar graph simultaneously to prioritize information the user wants. A reset button was included to reset the entire page easily. To complete the page, a ribbon was added to allow for navigation and any context information that wouldn’t be immediately applicable to the visualization (such as explanation video, documentation, about section, etc.).

        <h2>Rationale</h2>
            <h4>World Map</h4>
            <p>
                When tackling the questions posed by our dataset, the most obvious visualization we thought to implement was
                a global view.  First, we wanted the ability for the world map to encode a variable via color.  After iterating
                through functionality ideas, we settled on using the world map as a filtering tool that coordinated
                with the other assisting visualizations.  As the central visualization, the world map immediately draws attention while both
                providing information and filtering functionality.
            </p>
            <h4>Scatter Plot</h4>
            <p>
                The scatter plot was designed to aid the user in the investigation of the questions of “What does the global distribution of
                X metric look like?” and “How is happiness correlated with X metric?”. To answer the first question, “what does the global
                distribution of X metric look like?” the user can select the attributes it would like to investigate, whether that’s
                the overall happiness score, some contributing factor, or any combination thereof. Each country is then plotted as a circle
                with attribute 1 on the horizontal axis and attribute 2 on the vertical axis. To maintain a consumable distribution of data
                points on the graph, the axes will auto scale to maximize the distance between data points on the graph along each axis.
            </p>
            <p>
                To answer the second question, “How is happiness correlated with X metric?”, the user can investigate this by setting
                the attributes accordingly to see by the distribution of the data. They can then determine if there is any perceivable
                correlation between those attributes. Additionally, the functionality for the user to investigate the correlation of
                any two variables was built in by plotting 2 attributes rather than just the happiness score vs. a selected attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                To interact with the data on the scatterplot, the user can mouse over one of the circles representing that
                datapoint and that point will increase in size and intensity of color. When the user does this, the scoreboard, map,
                and bar graph will all also simultaneously highlight the element representing that country associated with the point
                on the scatterplot. This allows the user to see, not only where different countries appear on the scatterplot, but also
                where they are located on the map and where they rank in the bar graph.
            </p>
            <h4>Bar Plot</h4>
            <p>
                The intent of the bar plot was to emphasize the relative ranking of an attribute amongst a selection of countries. While the scatterplot emphasized attribute interactivity and the map introduced global positioning, the bar plot was an ideal tool for focusing on a single attribute and immediately conveying the landscape of that attribute. The bars were sorted to simplify the process of determining attribute rankings which otherwise would have to be approximated visually on the heat map, referred to in the scoreboard, or estimated on the scatterplot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To operate the bar plot, the dependent variable is the ‘attribute 1’ located in the top ribbon. The country selection links the map, scatterplot, and bar graph by highlighting (increasing saturation) of the particular bar when any of the 3 visualizations is hovered over. Changing the years, attribute 1, or region will filter the data provided in the bar plot. Deselecting countries on the map will change the linked bar in the bar plot gray. This deemphasizes this data while still keeping the data available to provide context. For small sample sizes, country labels were included on the x-axis to allow the user to easily find countries of interest simultaneously. For large sample sizes the hover function activates a country label to make it easier to determine what data is being looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this bar plot is specifically aimed at providing context to a single attribute, a large emphasis was placed on narrowing down the focus to a smaller sample. By restricting the region or deemphasizing unselected countries it is possible to focus on particular country relationships that are of interest to the audience. For example, the bar plot is the easiest method to answer questions like “which Eastern Asian countries have the highest GDP?” or “what Western European countries allow for greater amounts of freedom?”.

        <h2>Discoveries by Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                To recap, the visualization was intended to present answers to the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What country(countries) are the happiest?</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What makes a country happy?</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Is happiness correlated with X (metric)?</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
                <p>
                    By using bar plot, it is apparent that (by ranking) Switzerland (2015), Denmark (2016), Norway (2017), and Finland (2018, 2019) have the highest happiness ratings for each year. This is determined by cycling through different years with attribute 1 set on ‘Happiness Rating’. Though happiness is correlated to each metric (happiness score is a compilation of all other metrics), functionally happiness is dependent on the country. Happiness scores were polled, and any lack of direct correlation between the other 6 factors and happiness is combined in residual value ‘dystopia residual’. Thus, it is possible to note the greatest outliers between the metrics and the polled values by observing the ‘dystopia residual’ as attribute 1.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What does the global distribution of happiness look like?</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What does the global distribution of X (metric) look like?</li>
                            <li>Are any metrics clustered in certain areas as the highest/lowest?</li>
                        </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The global distribution of happiness favors Europe, North Ameria, Australia, and sections of South America. Most metrics followed this same pattern, except trust (government corruption) and generosity (social safety nets) were primarily centralized in southeast Asia/Austalia, Canada, and Scandanavia. The heat map is a useful tool for determining regional distributions of any of the 6 metrics.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Where does X country rank in global happiness?</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Where does X country rank in global Y (metric)?</li>
                        </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It is possible to determine the rank of any country by selecting the metric and finding it on the scatter plot of bar plot (bar plot is sorted). The corresponding rank is determined by position in the bar plot.
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li>How do the countries I select compare in overall happiness?</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How do the countries selected compare in X (metric)</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Countries can be selected by clicking on their respective locations on the world map. By doing so, they are highlighted in the map, scatterplot, and bar plot. It is easy to compare these values using the 3 visualizations.
