        The dataset chosen for our project is the world happiness report spanning the years 2015-2019.
        The world happiness report presents scores and rankings acquired from Gallup World Poll by asking
        “respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life
        being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale” (quoted pulled from the linked kaggle dataset description).
        The dataset also includes other interesting attributes that may contribute to happiness such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Economy (GPD per capita)</li>
        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Freedom</li>
        <li>Dystopian Residual</li>
        <li>And more</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px;">Data Manipulation: </h3>
    <p>
        Since the data we were using was distributed across 5 different files, representing the years 2015-2019,
        the data needed to be curated to make sure things such as regions, countries, and variables all matched names
        and casing.  Most of the changes to the csv files were done manually using find and replace features in an IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world map visualization, brought a whole new challenge to normalizing the data.  Considering that the world
        map data was found from a completely different data source and that it had to be translated using an online
        geojson translation tool, the country and region names did not match.  Actually, the regions were not event present.
        To mitigate this issue, we wrote a python script to map the names of the countries to those in one of the
        csv files.  After doing that we wrote another function in the same python script to add the regions from one of the csv
        files to the geojson properties of the country objects.  In doing so, the country names, ids, and regions were all
        present and usable when drawing the world map in our visualization.
